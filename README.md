MATE is a modular and configurable solution for digital asset management. It is designed to streamline the process of getting in and out of Mento stables for partners and ecosystem members.

## Overview

MATE defines and manages asset flows and steps. These flows are made up of sequential steps, which represent distinct operations that either move or transform digital assets. Moving a digital asset can encompass actions like transferring between bank accounts, withdrawing from exchanges, or bridging assets. Swapping a digital asset might involve executing a trade on either a centralized or decentralized exchange. Each flow is essentially a series of these steps, tailored and configured to ensure seamless asset management.

## Features

1. Withdraw Crypto from an Exchange: Enable the transfer of assets from a crypto exchange to an account on a specified blockchain.
2. Deposit Crypto to an Exchange: Enable the movement of an asset from an on-chain account back to a crypto exchange.
3. Fiat Onramp: Provide a mechanism for users to move fiat from a given bank account to a specified exchange.
4. Fiat Offramp: Allow users to convert a specific digital asset into fiat and transfer it from a crypto exchange to their bank account.
5. Rollback Mechanism: Automatically roll back or reverse any operations that were successfully executed in the event of a failed operation.
6. Configuration Validation: Validate the structure and data types of configurations against predefined expectations. Provide clear, actionable error messages when discrepancies or mismatches are detected, enabling quick resolution.
